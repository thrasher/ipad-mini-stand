# iPad Mini Holder
The largest iPad holder I could print in one piece on a Makerbot Mini's small build plate. It fits an iPad Mini, but can also hold a larger tablet.

The iPad mini can sit at either of two angles.

Tablets larger than an iPad mini may fall backwards on the larger angle, due to where their center of gravity is.
